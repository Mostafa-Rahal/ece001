    <li style="font-size: 300;">Strong AI</li>
    <p style="font-size: 300;">Since its inception, Artificial Intelligence has been ambitious to replicate human intelligence. Strong AI deals with designing a machine whose intelligence is unparalleled and indistinguishable from that of humans. Although this goal created great interest in the early days of AI, practical difficulties have weakened the optimism.</p>
    <li style="font-size: 300;">Applied AI</li>
    <p style="font-size: 300;">Applied AI is a more practical adaptation of Strong AI and works on producing smart systems that are commercially feasible. Applied AI has shown immense success by using advanced information processing. Biometric scanners, personal assistants, medical diagnosis systems, etc. are based on applied AI</p>
    <li style="font-size: 300;">Cognitive Simulation</li>
    <p style="font-size: 300;">Another goal of AI is to design and test the theories about the thought process of a human mind. Bioscience disciplines like Neuroscience and Psychology are using Cognitive Simulation as a popular tool to understand how we recall memories or past events and recognize places or people.</p>
